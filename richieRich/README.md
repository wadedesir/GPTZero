# Meet RichieRich: Elevating LLM user experiences

![RichieRich Logo](assets/richieRich.png)

## Introduction

We introduce RichieRich2.7A, an advanced large language model (LLM) with 10.7 billion parameters, demonstrating superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It's compact, yet remarkably powerful, and demonstrates unparalleled state-of-the-art performance in models with parameters under 30B.

## RichieRich Markup Language (RRML)

We return our responses formatted in RRML. RRML is an HTML-like SGML-based markup language that supports the following tags:

- `<header></header>`
- `<subheader>\</subheader>`
- `<body></body>`
- `<link href="http://example.com></link>`
- `<card></card>`

## API Usage

This document describes the API endpoints provided by the server.

### HTTP Endpoints

#### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Generates a model response for a given prompt.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "string"
}
```

**Response:**

The response will be a string generated by the model based on the provided prompt.

### WebSocket Endpoints

### `/v1/stream`

This WebSocket endpoint allows you to send a prompt and receive a stream of responses from the model.

**Sending a Message:**

To send a prompt, send a WebSocket message with the prompt as the message data.

**Receiving a Message:**

The server will send a series of messages with the model's responses. Each message will contain a part of the response. When the server has sent the entire response, it will close the connection.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following commands from the project directory root:

```
$ npm i
$ node server.js
```

The server will start on port 8082.
